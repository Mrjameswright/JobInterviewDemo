# JobInterviewDemo

POSforBigTools was created as a demo for a job interview. The code was written using the Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers on my laptop running Kali Linux. JUnit version 4 is used for testing. 

I commented out unused code. I would normally delete this code, but I thought the reviewer might find it interesting. 

If you have any feedback (positive or negative), please email me at mrjameswright@gmail.com

Thank you.
